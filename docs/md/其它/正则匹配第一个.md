location="(.*)" will match from the " after location= until the " after some="xxx unless you make it non-greedy.

So you either need .*? (i.e. make it non-greedy by adding ?) or better replace .* with [^"]*.

[^"] Matches any character except for a " <quotation-mark>
More generic: [^abc] - Matches any character except for an a, b or c

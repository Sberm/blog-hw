Trait: a set of functions a type must provide
```rust
// T is a type that has to provide functions defined in HasArea trait
fn print_area<T: HasArea>(shape: T) {
    println!("This shape has an area of {}", shape.area());
}
```

include
```rust
use crate::house::diner;

#[path = "./welcome-home.rs"]
mod welcome_home;

// Includes the function directly
// When using crate, you use the root directory to include everything.
use crate::house::diner;
```

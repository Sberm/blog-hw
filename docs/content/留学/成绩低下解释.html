<p>Due to serious situations of Covid-19 epidemic, university has brought up a remote class based education. Most of the time couldn't see professor's face, no communication with classmates and peers, no serious hands-on lab project because of unavailability of lab hardware, us students started to form a not-taking-classes-seriously atmosphere and of course it affects me, where I found myself lacking motivation of studying, not fully engaged in doing repetitive and tedious lab work, not taking acquiring good grades seriously. This leads to the pitfall of my freshman year grades.</p>
